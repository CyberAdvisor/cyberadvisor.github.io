  <p>Hello,</p>

  <p>My name is Michael Lines, founder of Heuristic Security. Now that I am retired, this website is as well, along with the articles I published over the years.</p>

  <p>Although I am no longer consulting or pursuing executive roles, I am open to serving on boards as an independent director with specific expertise in cyber risk governance. I work with directors to translate technical exposure into business impact, clarify risk tradeoffs, and strengthen oversight practices in a domain that is often poorly framed at the board level. If your organization would benefit from that perspective, I can be reached at <a href="mailto:michael.lines@heuristicsecurity.com"><b>michael.lines@heuristicsecurity.com</b></a>.</p>

  <p>I also provide informal guidance to startups on product positioning and value articulation, drawing on my background as a CISO, cyber product manager, and advisory services leader. I offer this input at no charge. Founders interested in a discussion may schedule time through <a href="https://cal.com/mikelines/meeting"><b>my calendar link</a></b>.</p>

  <p>With 50 years in IT and 25 in information security, I have developed a structured view of why cyber incidents continue to increase in frequency and impact. In my assessment, the core issue is not technical capability but how organizations conceptualize and govern cyber risk. A more detailed explanation of this framework is outlined in my book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heuristic-Risk-Management-Prepared-Yourself-ebook/dp/B0CR1SZ4Y2/"><b>Heuristic Risk Management</b></a></em>, available in multiple formats on Amazon worldwide.</p>
